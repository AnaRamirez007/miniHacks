        As university students, we are aware of the mental health issues that may arise when dealing with academics. 
        It is important to us to be aware of these issues and work towards helping others dealing with anxiety or stress. 
        Consequently, we created a mental health awareness webpage that will allow its user to reflect upon how they are feeling, 
        and then be exposed to comforting pictures of cats.
        Cats are known for being cute and calming creatures, therefore, this webpage shows cats.
