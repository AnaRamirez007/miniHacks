        As university students, we understand how brutal university can be on your mental helth. 
        It is important to us to be aware of these issues and work towards helping others deal with their anxiety and or stress. 
        Consequently, we created a mental health awareness webpage that will allow its user to reflect upon how they are feeling, 
        and, depending on their answer, they are directed to a seperate page where they are granted a small message and asked whether 
        they would like Happy Cat photos. Cats are known for being cute and calming creatures, therefore, this webpage provides cute and
        happy cats.
